The torrent of helplessness swept me away to the cavern of shame and the hall of dismay You're silent in the morning, suspended in the trees

If I pass out, take me to the round church And when I float high, take my arm and I'll fly you by I'm sittin' back here just sharin' in the groove Set the gearshift to the high gear of your soul

I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountains curl Should I spend my adolescent days wearing tie dyes or Vuarnets If I pass out, take me to the round church
